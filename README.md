# Awesome-Hololens [![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)
A curated list of awesome resources for developing Hololens apps
![Hololens](https://compass-ssl.surface.com/assets/53/71/53719e13-f992-4659-a4df-aa62fb1693b6.jpg?n=Buy_Panel_539.jpg)

The motivation for creating this list was that I couldn't easily find resources for adding move/scale/rotate feature to objects or making the Sharing works properly. Unity versions keeps changing, Holotoolkit evolves very fast, and the documentations take time to be updated. So the best we can do is to collect all resources.

## Tutorials
* [Academy](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/academy) Basic tutorials for learning how to create apps, not good for production since they're not using MixedRealityToolkit
*  [mtaulty Hololens Experience](https://mtaulty.com/category/hololens)
	*  [Windows Mixed Reality – Bootstrapping Your Development](https://mtaulty.com/2017/11/07/future-decoded-2017-resources/) One of the best intro to developing apps for Hololens. It covers:
		*  Windows Mixed Reality – Bootstrapping Your Development
		*  Windows Mixed Reality – Developing with Unity
*  [Design](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/design)
*  [Development](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/development)
*  [Sharing](https://github.com/Microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/blob/master/Assets/HoloToolkit/Sharing/README.md) Not a tutorial but a reference, use mtaulty tutorials instead.
*  [mtaulty Holotoolkit Sharing](https://mtaulty.com/2017/03/14/hitchhiking-the-holotoolkit-unity-leg-11-more-steps-with-sharing-holographic-experiences/)
*  [Move/Scale/Rotate](http://dotnetbyexample.blogspot.com/2017/01/manipulating-holograms-move-scale.html) Maybe not updated with the new MixedRealityToolkit.


## Libraries
These libraries are good for using in production since they reduce the time of developement
* [MixedRealityToolkit](https://github.com/Microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit) aka Holotoolkit, is a collection of scripts and components intended to accelerate the development of applications targeting Windows Mixed Reality.
* [MixedRealityToolkit-Unity](https://github.com/Microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity) aka HoloToolkit-Unity
* [MixedRealityCompanionKit](https://github.com/Microsoft/MixedRealityCompanionKit) repository for code bits and components that may not run directly on Microsoft HoloLens or immersive headsets but instead pair with them to build experiences.
* [MRDesignLabs_Unity](https://github.com/Microsoft/MRDesignLabs_Unity) 
	* [Interactable Object](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/interactable_object) Trigger an event like Buttons
	* Object Collection 
		* lay out an array of objects in predefined three-dimensional shapes. It supports four different surface styles - plane, cylinder, sphere and scatter. 
	* Progress
	* App Bar and Bounding Box
	* Dialog

## Reduce Number of Polygons
* [Simplygon](https://www.simplygon.com)
* [Blender LOD](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/LevelOfDetail.html)

## Third Party APIs
* [Cognitive Services](https://github.com/Microsoft/reality-augmentation-using-cognitive-services) Reality augmentation using Cognitive Services on Windows Mixed Reality
* Cloud Services like Google, Amazon, IBM, and Microsoft Image prossesing and Machine Learning Services.


## Open Source Apps
* [MS Sample Apps](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/category/sample_apps)  
	* [Periodic Table of the Elements](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/periodic_table_of_the_elements)
